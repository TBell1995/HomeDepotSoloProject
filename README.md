# HomeDepotSoloProject

This project will showcase my manual and automation efforts to test Homedepot.com

The main purpose of the website is to provide an online marketplace for customers to browse what they're looking for, give advice and ideas for diy projects, give the user the option to view installation and services, allows the user to create lists and add favorited items to said lists, etc. 

Testing Manually:
1. Exploritory Testing
2. Create an account (protected by reCAPTCHA)
3. Add to Cart/Checkout

Testing with Automation
1. Search-Bar
2. Logo/Home button
3. Lists/Favorites
4. Shop by Brand
